    <p class = "intro-text" > This past spring break, I traded out Los Angeles for New York. This was my second time visiting the city, and I was so excited to do a food tour of different areas. Explore my day-by-day journey in the Big Apple by clicking the food pictures below. </p>

    <p> Day 1: Landing in Connecticut (3/20/2025) </p>
    <img src="images/chinese.jpg" id="chinese" alt="Dinner at Basil Restaurant" width="30%"/> -->
    <!-- <p> After 8 hours of travel I meet up with my cousin in New Haven, Connecticut for a heartwarming wonton soup dinner! <br> It was nice to finally eat real food. The restaurant was empty and we caught up on the past few weeks.
    </p> -->

    <!-- <p> Day 2: Popups & Sweet Treats in Manhattan & Chelsea </p>
    <img src="images/victoria1.JPG" alt="Victoria's Secret Popup" width="50%"> -->
    <!-- <img src="images/victoria2.JPG" alt="Victoria's Secret Popup" width="50%"> -->
<!-- <p> We start off the day by going to a Victoria’s Secret pop up, where we got free perfume samples and coffee. <br> I really liked the paper flowers on the side of the truck. <br> The line was long but we cracked jokes along the way. <br> The coffee was not good, but perhaps it is simply because I don’t like black coffee.
</p>
<img src="images/wanwaan.JPG" alt="Thai Food" width="50%">
<p>For lunch, we head over to a Thai restaurant where I devoured the most delicious pad kee mao, paired with a Thai tea. <br> We eat in silence because we are so hungry. <br> The waiter comes around pretty often to take trash and refill waters.</p> -->
<!-- 
<img src="images/787coffee.jpg" alt="787 Coffee" width="50%">
<p> We head to another pop-up where they are selling coffee in IV bags. This is such a New York thing to do.
</p>
<img src = "images/anmitsu.JPG" alt = "Yamada Stand" width="50%">
<p> We walked around Chelsea market before heading to Japan Village, where we picked up a yummy mochi ice cream fruit bowl! <br> I liked the jelly and vanilla ice cream the most. <br> For some reason, the green tea ice cream was lukewarm? <br> It threw me off but the dessert was still pretty delicious.
</p>

<img src = "images/gentlemonster.JPG" alt = "Gentle Monster" width="50%">
<p> Gentle Monster glasses try on!!! <br> They had the coolest store with larger than life animatronics. <br> If i were a rich fashion model living in Manhattan, I would come here so often they would know me by name.
</p>

<img src = "images/tearoom.jpg" alt = "Chai Room" width="50%">
<p>Visited old friends at the Chai Spot! <br> We caught up on the last two years of life. <br> Cheers to reconnecting and good chai <3 
</p>
<img src = "images/goldenbun.jpg" alt = "Golden Bun" width="50%">
<p> I had the most yummy egg yolk buns for dinner. <br> I had to eat them on the train back since I was rushing to Grand Central station to take the train back to Connecticut. <br> Note to self: Be better with time management. 
</p> -->

<!-- <p> Day 3: Exploring Brooklyn </p>
<img src = "images/chefkatsu.JPG" alt = "Chef Katsu" width="50%"> -->
<!-- <p> I started off the day with a strawberry hojicha latte at Chef Katsu in Brooklyn. <br> 
    I also ordered the pork katsu bowl and pumpkin soup. <br>
    I finished both and felt so good afterwards knowing I had a balanced meal. <br>
    I came before it got packed and snagged the corner table (the best spot in my opinion). <br>
    I sat next to a group of 20-something friends presumably catching up on the weekend, <br> and a girl and her younger sister sharing a burger and fries.
    <br>How lovely it is to people watch!
</p>

<p> I stopped briefly by the Brooklyn flea market after walking 45 minutes to get there. <br>
    It was so windy that I regretted not taking the train!! <br>
    The flea was very busy, and reminded me a lot of Silverlake. <br>
    I’m not surprised that the prices were astronomical. <br>
    One belt i was looking at was over $100!! <br>
    The vendor claimed that it was vintage designer but I doubt that’s true for the quality.
